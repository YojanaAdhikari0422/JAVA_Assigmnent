My 'Academic Lab Exercise in Java' included writing this software to practice fundamental Object-Oriented Programming ideas.  The assignment is to use Java classes and methods to create a basic student management system.

  Goal of the Task
  Create a `Student` class with the following private attributes: course, age, student ID, name, and grades in five disciplines.
  Put into practice:
  The `calculateTotalMarks()` method returns the sum of marks, and a constructor initializes data
  To return the grade depending on the percentage, use the `calculateGrade()` method.
  To print all student information, use the `displayDetails()` method.
 Utilizing user input, accept the information of a student.
 Show the grade and total points earned by each student.
 Ideas  Practiced

 Encapsulation of classes and objects (private attributes with public methods)
  Use of constructors
  Subject mark storage arrays
 Validation of input (marks 0â€“100)
 Clear method-based framework
